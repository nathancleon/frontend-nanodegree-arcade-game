#Udacity Arcade Game, Project 3

This project is part of Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree and its purpose is to help students cement the concepts learn in the Object Oriented JavaScript course and the HTML Canvas course. The game is inspired by the Frogger game and Udacity provided the engine and resources for the player to build on to create a functional game.a

##Instructions

Download the application to a local directory by clicking [this link](https://github.com/nathancleon/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git). 

Once the file has been downloaded, open the **index.html** file in a browser that supports JavaScript. Make sure your browser does not have JavaScript turned off in its settings.

Use the arrow keys to move the player across the stage and make sure not to run into any enemies!

Once your character reaches the water at the top of the level, you're safe and you've won the game.
